# The Tiles wall is a composed source, and composed sources are ERASED not tombstoned (#448 slice 2 task 4, 2026-09-12)

_Moved verbatim from `CLAUDE.md` (#737). Paths are relative to the repo root._

**It has a production WRITER and, as of this slice, no production READER.**
`MediaCore::renderSyntheticTick` registers and releases walls for real, and the
only consumers are tests (`sourceRegistrySnapshotForTest`). That is deliberate —
per `docs/BACKLOG.md`, a #419 foundation lands on `main` only together with a real
consumer, and wall registration IS that consumer for the registry's write side —
but it means nothing in the product yet behaves differently because of these
entries. Do not describe the registry as "wired" beyond that, and expect the
first real reader (the multiview PVW cell, plan 2) to be where its snapshot shape
gets its first genuine test.

`SourceRegistry` (`native/src/core/SourceRegistry.h`, carved out of #419 unwired
onto main) gained `Kind::Composed` for sources the CORE renders rather than
captures — the Tiles wall is the first one. `MediaCore::renderSyntheticTick`
registers a live wall as `Kind::Composed` (sourceId = its layerId, `externalId`
empty, a fixed `kCoreProcessEpoch`) and releases it the tick nothing on either
bus names it any longer, in lockstep with `tilesWallSources_.releaseAllExcept` —
the same "referenced by a live scene" lifetime, one level up. `registeredWallIds_`
is the idempotence guard so a live wall's steady-state tick never touches the
registry mutex (`unordered_set::contains` before `insert`, not `insert().second`
— MSVC's `unordered_set::insert` has historically built the node before
detecting the duplicate, so this file's render-path no-allocation rule holds by
construction, not by implementation detail). A registration that fails
(`Invalid`/`Conflict`/`Exhausted`) is NOT remembered as registered, so the next
liveness transition retries it rather than abandoning the wall silently forever.

**A composed source carries no SDK handle and never claims a subscription
state.** `personId`, `externalId`, `availability`, `subscriptionRequested`,
`subscriptionObserved` are all `nullopt` for it — `nullopt` means NOT
APPLICABLE, never false — because a wall has no provider process and nothing
ever subscribes to it. `setAvailability`/`setSubscription` refuse `Composed`
outright for exactly this reason — `setSubscription`'s refusal was MISSING and
this file asserted it anyway for a day (final-review finding, fixed with
`SourceRegistryComposed.SetSubscriptionOnAWallIsRefusedOutright`): an
`observed:true` call was already refused as a side effect, because a nullopt
availability is not `Available`, but `requested:true, observed:nullopt` applied
cleanly and turned a NOT-APPLICABLE field into a concrete claim. Nothing in the
tree called it for a wall, so only the documentation was wrong — which is exactly
how an invariant rots.

**A wall id too long to register is SKIPPED, not retried** (same finding).
`SourceRegistry::kMaxIdBytes` (512) is the one declared bound on every id-shaped
field, and it is public precisely so a caller can tell a PERMANENTLY refusable id
from a transiently refused one: the registration loop deliberately does not
remember a failed add as registered (so a transient failure retries on the next
liveness transition), which turned a spelling-based refusal into a registry-mutex
acquisition plus a log line on EVERY render tick. `unregisterableWallIds_` skips
those once and loudly; `warnedWallRegistrationIds_` bounds the retryable
failures' log line to once per id while keeping the retry. Both are pruned on the
same liveness rule as `registeredWallIds_`, or a wall re-cued under a corrected
id would stay skipped or silent for the life of the process.

**A composed source is ERASED (`SourceRegistry::removeComposed`), never
tombstoned — and this is not a simplification, it is the only mechanism that
actually works.** Every other kind's departure is `Availability::Departed`
(kept for diagnostics via `retireProcessEpoch`/`setAvailability`). A composed
entry CANNOT be tombstoned that way even in principle: `setAvailability`
refuses `Composed`, so nothing can ever flip it to `Departed`, and because its
`availability` stays `nullopt` forever, `externalConflict`'s
`availability != Departed` test reads true for it PERMANENTLY — a tombstoned
wall id could never be reused by `add()` again. `removeComposed` erases the
`sources_` entry outright and refuses (`Invalid`) for any non-`Composed` kind.
It takes a bare `SourceId`, deliberately not a `Token`: the caller must be the
SOLE owner of a composed source's lifetime (`replace()` exists precisely so an
OLD callback cannot retire a NEW instance it no longer owns via compare-and-
replace; removal has no such fence and must never grow a second writer).

**Its lifetime is scene-reference, exactly like `TilesWallSources`
(`releaseAllExcept`) one level down** — a wall no live scene names is gone from
the registry the same render tick `tilesWallSources_` releases its animation
object, and a wall released then re-cued under the same scene id is a
genuinely NEW registry entry (a fresh `instanceId`, minted from the registry's
own revision counter), never the old one resurrected.

Tests: `native/tests/SourceRegistryComposedTest.cpp` (`removeComposed`: erases,
frees the id for reuse, refuses non-composed, `NotFound` on an unknown id) and
`native/tests/TilesRenderPlanTest.cpp` (a live wall registers as `Composed`
with all five capture-only fields `nullopt`; an unreferenced wall is gone from
the registry; a released-then-re-cued wall gets a new `instanceId`; a wall
staying live across many ticks keeps the SAME registry identity — pinned by
`instanceId` equality, not a source count, because `sources_` is a
`std::map` keyed by sourceId where a count assertion cannot distinguish "the
guard works" from "every tick refuses `Conflict` while quietly taking the
registry mutex 60x/s").
